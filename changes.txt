- Patched Apps/debloater module with better apps detection and status report, some async functions (no more UI freezing) and possibility to hide system apps, import own bloatware lists (try importing "bloatwareapps-11.txt" located in data folder) and several other UI fixes.

- Refactored data storing (now everything app related is stored in root "data" folder of ThisIsWin11 (old "custom" folder is no longer necessary and can be removed)

- Changed default font in Preview window to Consolas (it was previously Cascadia Code which is per default available on Win11, but Consolas is just my favorite monospaced font)
