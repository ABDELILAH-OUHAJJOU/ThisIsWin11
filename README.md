## Features
A customer asked me to quickly present Windows 11. So i threw some of the news from [theverge](https://www.theverge.com), [windowscentral](https://www.windowscentral.com) and others into an form and added a magic - feature demonstration - button. Now you can navigate your way through a short Windows 11 tour using this magic button, which only works under Windows 11. 
 
You can of course also use the app and click through under Windows 10, but with a little less fun. 
  
**An internet connection is required to use the app.**
  
 For the future i plan to open the possibility to configure Windows 11 in the wizard as well. Basic things like background image, privacy etc, provide tweaks to get better started e.g. how to get classic context menu of file explorer back and community optimizations.
