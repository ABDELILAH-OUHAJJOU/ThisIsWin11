 ThisIsWin11 lets you customize Windows 11 all in one place. It is slowly expanded as a practical all-rounder for Windows 11, similar to Microsoft PowerToys.
 
The app currently offers six modules:

- **Presenter** ThisIsWin11 is starting off with a helpful introduction to what you can find in Windows 11.
- **OpenTweaks** integrates an important part of the Windows 11 settings app and allows you to check and enable/disable settings in a bulk and with just a click.
- **PumpedApp** makes it possible to remove unwanted features and apps from Windows 11 such as the Camera and Alarm apps, and other preinstalled bloat that you can live without.
- **Packages** powered by [Windows Package Manager](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) allows you to create your own custom install packages.
- **PowerUI** allows you automating several Windows 11 tasks based on PowerShell and community scripts, e.g. It is possible to boost privacy by disabling various telemetry-related components of Windows 11
 - **Extensions** allows you creating custom tweaks
 
If you know my previous apps ([Privatezilla](https://github.com/builtbybel/privatezilla), [Bloatbox](https://github.com/builtbybel/bloatbox) etc.) for Windows 10 then you will see that the **ThisIsWin11** app combines the best of these apps under one GUI but on Windows 11.
